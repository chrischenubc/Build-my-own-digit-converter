# Build-my-own Decimal-Binary-HexDecimal converter

## Introduction
when learning computer digital system design, I have to perform lots of calculations from decimal to binary or binary to
hex-decimal, or vice versa.
Often I used online tool to perform these steps, but I found it is fun to build-my-own digit converter.

I developed this in Python without using external python modules.

The algorithm is done by recursion.

Unittest is also included.
